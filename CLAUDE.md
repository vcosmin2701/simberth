# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

simberth runs a fleet of iOS simulators, each driven by its own Claude agent, and
shows what they're testing. It is a **fork of
[simslim](https://github.com/MobAI-App/simslim)** (MIT, Interlap/MobAI) and stacks
two things:

1. **Inherited from simslim:** disabling the background daemons a simulator doesn't
   need, cutting each simulator's memory ~4x so a laptop fits a screenful of them.
   Everything is driven through `xcrun simctl`; the tool only ever touches the
   simulators you point it at, never the host Mac. macOS-only.
2. **Added by this fork:** agent orchestration (fleet lease, run/step model,
   NDJSON event stream), a TypeScript agent runner built on the Claude Agent SDK,
   simulator UI control via the AXe CLI, and a Runs section in the macOS app.

**Working with upstream.** `upstream` remote is MobAI-App/simslim. Keep the root
package's exported API unchanged so upstream merges stay mechanical; put new
orchestration code in new files/packages rather than editing inherited ones where
you reasonably can.

## Commands

```sh
go build ./cmd/simberth          # build the CLI
go test ./...                   # run all tests (Makefile: make test)
go test -run TestName ./...     # run a single test
make check                      # full CI gate — must pass before a PR
make format                     # gofmt + swift-format (run before committing)
make app                        # build build/Simberth.app (Go + swiftc, macOS only)
open build/Simberth.app
```

`make check` runs `go test`, `go vet`, `swift-format lint --strict --recursive gui`,
`zsh -n scripts/build-app.sh`, and `plutil -lint gui/Info.plist`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
runs exactly this on macos-26 / Xcode 26.6, then builds and verifies the app bundle.

Tests are pure unit tests (parsing, delta logic, allowlist invariants) — they do
**not** boot real simulators, so they run anywhere. Only the app build and manual
runs need Xcode + an iOS runtime.

## Architecture

Two packages. The repo root is `package simberth`, an importable library holding
every piece of slimming logic and **no external dependencies**. `cmd/simberth/`
is `package main`, the CLI: `main.go` dispatches `os.Args[1]` to a `cmd*`
function per subcommand and enforces macOS-only up front.

Anything that talks to a terminal — printing, `--json` encoding via `writeJSON`,
the interactive wizard in `wizard.go`, `fatal()`, `usage()` — lives in
`cmd/simberth/`. The library never writes to stdout; it returns values and
reports progress through the `Reporter` callback the caller supplies.

Exported identifiers in the root package are the public API, so renaming one is
a breaking change for importers as well as for the CLI.

**The slimming model (the core idea).** `profiles.go` defines `Categories`, an
allowlist of launchd daemon labels grouped by user-facing feature (siri, search,
icloud, …). Categories may overlap — a label lives in every category whose
feature needs it (e.g. the AMS payment-sheet daemons are in both `store` and
`icloud`), and `Profile.Desired()` keeps a label enabled when **any** excepted
category lists it. `SlimmableSet()` is the deduplicated union of every label in
`Categories`.
`managedSet()` adds each category's `AlwaysEnabled` compatibility services,
which simberth may only repair back to enabled; these are **the only labels the
tool may ever disable or enable.** Anything outside those sets is never touched.
`service_descriptions.go` supplies the short per-daemon explanations shown by
the GUI; its coverage and length are enforced in `profiles_test.go`.
`profile_file.go` loads a committed JSON profile (`simberth on --profile <path>`)
whose `except`/`keep` arrays mirror the flags of the same name, validates it
against the allowlist, and resolves it to a `Profile`. The dependency-free
`profile` command's interactive wizard lives in `cmd/simberth/wizard.go`.
`features.go` defines `Features`, a finer-grained catalog than `Categories`:
each feature (push, storekit, universal-links, …) names just the daemons one
testable capability needs. `doctor` reads a booted simulator's disabled labels
and reports any required feature whose daemons are down, exiting non-zero — a CI
preflight. `features_test.go` asserts every feature label is slimmable.
`slim.go`'s `ensure()` rejects a non-empty slim profile on runtimes older than
iOS 18.5 before booting or mutating the device, then reads the currently disabled
labels, computes a `delta` against the desired set, and applies the changes with
`launchctl disable/enable` run inside the simulator via `simctl spawn`. It reboots
and reads the state back before reporting persistence. `on` disables the profile;
`off` remains available on every runtime and re-enables the whole managed set.

**simctl wrapper.** `simctl.go` is the only place that shells out to
`xcrun simctl` (list/boot/shutdown/clone/erase/delete/spawn). `measure.go` sums
`phys_footprint` across the simulator's launchd process tree (via `pgrep`/`ps`/`top`)
— that's the memory figure that decides how many simulators fit. `MeasureProcesses`
keeps the per-process detail (footprint + cpu, from the same snapshot) for the
`top` drill-down. `fleet.go`'s `FleetSnapshot` composes booted devices + slim
status + `MeasureMany` into the fleet view; the live TUI is `cmd/simberth/top.go`
(Bubble Tea), which also has a `--json`/non-TTY one-shot fallback. `disk.go`,
`disk_cleanup.go`, and `disk_inventory.go` handle disk measurement and the
separate, permanent disk-cleanup feature.

**JSON is a contract.** Every read-only and management command supports `--json`.
The structs in `output.go` (`DeviceSummary`, `StatusOutput`,
`SimulatorMutationOutput`, etc.) plus the category/plan structs are the stable
interface the SwiftUI app decodes. Changing a JSON field breaks the GUI in
`gui/*.swift` — keep them in sync. `gui/Backend.swift` invokes the bundled CLI
with `--json` and decodes these types; there is no other IPC.

**The SwiftUI app** (`gui/`) has no Xcode project. `scripts/build-app.sh` compiles
the Swift sources directly with `swiftc`, cross-builds the Go CLI, bundles it into
`Simberth.app/Contents/Resources/simberth`, generates the icon, and ad-hoc codesigns.
The app is a thin front end that shells out to that bundled binary.

## Safety invariants — preserve these

- **Never add a deadlock-prone daemon to `Categories`.** A handful of daemons wedge
  a simulator when disabled. `profiles_test.go` holds a `forbiddenLabels` list and
  asserts none appear in any category; if you add labels, keep that test green.
- **Only managed labels are ever mutated.** `delta()` is scoped to `managedSet()`
  on both sides. Compatibility labels are omitted from every desired slim state,
  so they can only be repaired to enabled.
- **Destructive/management commands resolve the exact UDID first** (`findDevice` /
  `shutdownIfBooted`) so a `simctl` alias like `all` can never fan out a boot,
  erase, delete, or filesystem path across every simulator.
- **Disk cleanup only removes allowlisted per-device directories**, refuses to run
  without `--confirm`, and never touches the shared, signed iOS runtime (built-in
  apps, core OS language resources). `disk-plan` is strictly read-only. Durable
  storage (Documents, app bundles, user media) is measured but never deletable.

## Conventions

- CLI parsing uses `github.com/urfave/cli/v3`; the `top` command's live TUI uses
  `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea` + `lipgloss`. These are the CLI's only
  dependencies — the root library still has none, so importers never inherit a
  terminal stack. The command tree lives in `cmd/simberth/app.go` (`newApp`);
  each subcommand's `Action` is a `cmd*` function in `cmd/simberth/main.go` that
  reads flags via `cmd.Bool/String(...)` and positionals via `cmd.Args()`. Flags may appear before or after positional args
  (e.g. `simberth on <udid> --except search`) — v3 parses flags anywhere by default.
  `--set` is a global flag (inherited by every subcommand) registered in its flag
  `Action`. `main.go` still owns `version`/`help`/no-args and the macOS-only guard
  before handing off to the tree, and routes every command error through `fatal()`
  for the stable `simberth: <msg>` (exit 1); unknown commands exit 2 with usage.
- Two timeouts live in `simctl.go`: `ShutdownTimeout` (30s, a const) and `BootTimeout`
  (10min, because a first slim reconfigure boots twice). `BootTimeout` is a package var,
  not a const, so the CLI's global `--boot-timeout` flag (env `SIMBERTH_BOOT_TIMEOUT`,
  wired in `app.go` like `--set`) can raise it for slow CI runners where the per-daemon
  `launchctl` transitions would otherwise blow the deadline mid-reconfigure.
- Progress for multi-minute operations goes to **stderr** via the `Reporter` callback;
  machine-readable JSON goes to **stdout**. Under `--json`, suppress the stderr
  chatter so consumers reading a combined stream still get clean JSON.
- Memory estimates (`ApproxMemoryMB`) are iOS-26.5 clean-boot medians and are
  **not additive**. Every category must have a positive measured estimate.
